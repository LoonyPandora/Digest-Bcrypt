1.0.0   2012-04-07

    [ BUGFIX ]
    * Remove accidental dependency on perl 5.10
      introduced in previous revision

    [ FEATURE ]      
    * bcrypt_b64digest method added to return digest
      base64 encoded using the base 64 alphabet commonly
      used with bcrypt

    * b64digest method now returns a base64 that is
      compatible with the standard MIME alphabet.

      To access the version of base64 commonly used with
      bcrypt, use the new bcrypt_b64digest method

      This is a backwards incompatible change
